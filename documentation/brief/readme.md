# Brief
Family Fortunes, known in the US as Family Feud, is a gameshow in which two teams try to guess 'most popular' answers to questions.  The more popular an answer, the more points it's worth.  Once they have given three answers that are not on the board, the team forfeits that round, and the other team have a chance to steal by identifying any of the remaining answers.

The format of Family Fortunes is actually very useful for an educational setting. It's easy to understand, questions educators pose often have 'popularities' (or rankings). However, there's no easy tool to run a Family Fortunes-style game in a classroom.

Your task is develop a utility which can be used to run a Family Fortunes style game (which, for legal reasons, is not called Family Fortunes, and does not use any of their assets), in a classroom.  It should be easy for an educator to create their own questions (and answers), and easy for them to run the session in a classroom. You'll need to think about how the instructor would be able to enter answers given by the teams, how they are revealed, and how "near misses" are dealt with.

Your utility could run as a standalone app, or a website, or be built into a utility that educators are already familiar with (e.g. PowerPoint, using VBA/macros).
